I implemented several CI/CD pipelines to streamline the development, testing, and deployment processes. Initially, I set up a pipeline to automatically build and push Docker images to Docker Hub whenever changes were detected in the main branch. Later, I enhanced this pipeline by integrating AWS credentials into GitHub repo secrets, allowing the image to be pushed to Amazon ECR instead. I also updated the pipeline to deploy the Docker image directly to an EC2 instance, ensuring a seamless transition from code to deployment. Additionally, I created a pipeline that runs unit tests and builds the project whenever a pull request is opened, and I incorporated security by adding a vulnerability scanning step. To maintain code quality, I enforced GitHub branch rules that require pull request approvals and status checks on the main branch. Finally, I developed a pipeline to build the frontend application and deploy it to an NGINX server, ensuring that the latest version is always available to users.
